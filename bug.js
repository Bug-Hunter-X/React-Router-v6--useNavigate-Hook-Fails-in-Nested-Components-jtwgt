In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when navigating using the `useNavigate` hook within a function component that's not directly rendered by the router. This often happens when you try to navigate from a child component deeply nested within the component tree.  The problem manifests as the navigation seemingly not working or throwing unexpected errors, even though the `useNavigate` function appears to be called correctly.

```javascript
//Incorrect Usage
function MyComponent() {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleClick = () => {
    navigate('/home'); 
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Go to Home</button>
    </div>
  );
}

// Component that renders MyComponent, but not directly routed
function ParentComponent(){
  return <MyComponent/>
}

//Route declaration
<Route path="/" element={<ParentComponent/>}/>
```
